In this article, we will discuss how to integrate [Jazzcash](https://www.jazzcash.com.pk/corporate/online-payment-gateway/) Payment Gateway
into [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/) package [jazzcash-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jazzcash-checkout) in few simple steps.

## What is JazzCash?

JazzCash is a digital payment platform and mobile wallet service in Pakistan, owned by Jazz, one of the largest
mobile network operators in the country. JazzCash enables users to transfer funds, pay bills, and buy products
and services using their mobile phones. It offers a range of features and services, including bill payments for
utilities, mobile top-ups, and online shopping. Additionally, it provides an Online Payment Gateway to integrate
into your website. JazzCash has become an important part of Pakistan's digital economy, promoting financial
inclusion, and reducing the use of cash in the country. This has improved security and reduced the risk of fraud
and theft.

## What is Jazzcash Checkout?

JazzCash checkout is a Node.js package on the available NPM that provides a simple interface for integrating
JazzCash payment gateway with your applications. It allows users to make digital payments, transfer money,
and pay bills online through multiple payment channels such as credit cards, debit cards, and mobile wallets.
The package simplifies the process of handling JazzCash transactions and provides a secure and reliable way
to accept payments online.

## How to integrate Jazzcash Checkout with NodeJS?

#### Prerequisite

- Node Server 12.x or above

### Steps

1. Use the following command `npm i jazzcash-checkout` or `yarn add jazzcash-checkout` in terminal to install **jazzcash-checkout** package.
2. Now, create a file called `jazzcash.js` in your app.
3. Put the following code in your file.

```javascript
const Jazzcash = require('jazzcash-checkout');

// initializes your jazzcash
Jazzcash.credentials({
  config: {
    merchantId: '', // Merchant Id
    password: '', // Password
    hashKey: '', // Hash Key
  },
  environment: 'sandbox', // available environment live or sandbox
});

const JC = {
  wallet: (data, callback) => {
    Jazzcash.setData(data);
    Jazzcash.createRequest('WALLET').then(res => {
      res = JSON.parse(res);
      console.log(res);

      // callback function
      callback(res);
    });
  },

  pay: (data, callback) => {
    Jazzcash.setData(data);
    Jazzcash.createRequest('PAY').then(res => {
      console.log(res);

      // callback function
      callback(res);
    });
  },

  refund: (data, callback) => {
    Jazzcash.setData(data);
    Jazzcash.createRequest('REFUND').then(res => {
      res = JSON.parse(res);
      console.log(res);

      // callback function
      callback(res);
    });
  },

  inquiry: (data, callback) => {
    Jazzcash.setData(data);
    Jazzcash.createRequest('INQUIRY').then(res => {
      res = JSON.parse(res);
      console.log(res);

      // callback function
      callback(res);
    });
  },
};

module.exports = JC;
```

Replace `Merchant Id`, `Password`, `Hash Key` with the values provided by the jazzcash payment gateway.<br/>

4. Now, call the `JC` module where you want to use it.

```javascript
const JC = require('/path/to/JC');

// function used to pay
const pay = (req, res) => {
  const data = {
    pp_Version: '1.1',
    pp_DiscountedAmount: '',
    pp_DiscountBank: '',
    pp_Amount: '1000',
    pp_TxnCurrency: 'PKR',
    pp_BillReference: 'billRef123',
    pp_Description: 'Description of transaction',
  };

  JC.pay(data, res => {
    if (res.pp_SecureHash) {
      // success code here
    } else {
      // failure code here
    }
  });
};
```

By using the pay function provided by the package to generate a secure hash string for your payment request.
Once you have the data with the secure hash , you can send the payment request from either your backend or frontend.

It's worth noting that when using JazzCash in production, you should obtain the production environment credentials
and update the environment value in the jazzcash.js file accordingly.  
Also, it's recommended to follow the best practices for securely handling sensitive information, such as encrypting
your JazzCash credentials and not exposing them in your code or on the client-side.  
Additionally, you may want to implement error handling and validation to ensure that the payment requests and responses
are handled correctly and securely.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, integrating JazzCash payment gateway with your NodeJS application can be easily achieved by using the
npm package called Jazzcash Checkout. With this integration, you can offer your users a secure and reliable way to
make digital payments, transfer money, and pay bills online through multiple payment channels. The package simplifies
the process of handling JazzCash transactions and provides a convenient way to accept payments online. It's important
to follow the best practices for securely handling sensitive information and implement error handling and validation
to ensure that payment requests and responses are handled correctly and securely. By integrating JazzCash payment
