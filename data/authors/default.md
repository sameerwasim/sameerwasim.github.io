Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sameer, a Software Engineer who loves to create and design innovative solutions. With a diverse background and a wealth of experiences, I've honed my skills across various domains within the tech industry.

### My Journey

My journey began in 2019 when I started my career at **Master Communication**, an ISP. Here, I gained valuable insights into web servers and the internet, laying a strong foundation in the tech world. I then moved on to [**Azi Solutions**], where I contributed to the development of web and mobile applications using the MERN Stack.

I'm currently a Full Stack Developer at [**Mir Tech**](https://www.mirtech.io/), where I'm working on an AI-based SaaS application using technologies like JavaScript and Python. I'm passionate about solving challenges and delivering top-notch solutions that meet the business's needs.

Before Mir Tech, I was part of the team at [**Ripeseed**](https://ripeseed.io), where I worked on cloud-based web and mobile applications using various technologies.

#### Technology Toolbox

My toolbox includes a mastery of technologies like React, NextJS, NodeJS, and more. I'm committed to staying at the forefront of technology and using these tools to create innovative and efficient solutions.

#### Freelancing Experience

My journey isn't limited to my professional roles. Since 2017, I've been an active freelancer, allowing me to work on exciting, innovative projects outside the corporate world. This freelancing experience has been instrumental in nurturing my creativity and pushing the boundaries of my ideas.

### Expertise

With a skill set that spans JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Python, and a range of frameworks and libraries, I'm adept at building, optimizing, and maintaining full-stack web applications. In addition, my expertise in Generative AI, databases, and Cloud/DevOps tools enhances my ability to deliver robust, efficient, and scalable solutions.

I'm deeply passionate about developing and designing unique and impactful solutions. My creativity, coupled with my knowledge and experience, makes me a valuable asset to any project. I look forward to each new challenge and the opportunity to bring my expertise to the table.
