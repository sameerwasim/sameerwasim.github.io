Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a love for designing and developing weird things. I've had a range of experiences in the field, from building cloud-based web and mobile applications to working at an internet service provider.

Currently, I'm working at [RipeSeed](https://ripeseed.io) as a Software Engineer, where I'm contributing to the development of various cloud-based web and mobile applications on AWS. I'm using technologies like React, NextJS, NodeJS, and more to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of the business.

Before that, I worked at [Wellcreator](https://wellcreator.com) as a Software Engineer, where I helped build web and mobile applications related to the automotive industry.

My journey began in 2019 when I worked at Master Communication an ISP, where I gained valuable knowledge about how web servers and the internet work. This experience gave me a solid foundation in this field.

Aside from my professional work, I've been freelancing since 2017, which has given me the opportunity to work on exciting projects outside of my professional work. This has allowed me to explore my creativity and experiment with my ideas.

Overall, I'm passionate about developing and designing weird things, which is a reflection of my innovative approach to the field. My experience, knowledge, and creativity make me an asset to any project I work on.
