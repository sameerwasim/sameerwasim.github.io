Hello there! 👋

I'm Sameer, a Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience. I've spent the past few years working remotely with startups, helping them take ideas from concept to launch. Recently, I moved to **Canada** 🇨🇦 and I'm continuing my journey in tech from here.

### My Journey

I started my career in 2019 at **Master Communication**, an ISP, where I learned about web servers and networking. I then joined [**AZi Solutions**](https://azsolutionspk.com/) and spent over 2 years building web and mobile applications using the MERN Stack.

I'm currently a **Senior Software Engineer** at a US-based **Stealth AI Startup**, working remotely from Canada.

Previously, I worked at [**eesel AI**](https://eesel.ai) as a Software Engineer, building AI-powered productivity tools.

Before that, I was a Full Stack Developer at [**Mir Tech**](https://www.mirtech.io/), where I worked on AI-based SaaS applications including [**Jensi**](https://jensi.io), a platform for businesses to manage their operations and workflows. I also spent over a year at [**RipeSeed**](https://ripeseed.io), working on cloud-based web and mobile applications.

### What I Do

I've worked on projects involving Generative AI, Python, automation, and training. I enjoy fast-moving environments where ownership and problem-solving matter.

#### Technology Toolbox

I work with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **React**, **NextJS**, **NodeJS**, and more. I specialize in:

- SaaS Development
- Web Development
- Cloud Application Development
- Generative AI & Prompt Engineering

#### Freelancing

Since 2017, I've also been freelancing on the side, working on various projects outside my full-time roles.

### Expertise

My skill set spans JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Python, and various frameworks. I build and maintain full-stack web applications, and I have experience with Generative AI, databases, and Cloud/DevOps tools.

I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations. Let's connect!
